            <p>Recently, I remembered an amazing pizza place I visited a few times several years ago. I tried googling it for half an hour while commuting, but it was no use. But then again, five years had passed, and I wasnâ€™t sure the place still exists. Later that week, I decided to walk around that part of the city, hoping I would find it. You know what? I succeeded! They did have a website, but I still could not find it via Google and had to go directly to the website to access it.</p>
